1. How do I patch?

2. Pokemon keep 'getting away' when I use the Dexnav?
Hold 'a' while walking.
3. How do I evolve trade Evolutions?

6. Where is X Pokemon?
The original download for the game includes a Wild Encounters document.
7. How do I get Ph.D. Pikachu?
Open your PC at home, and select Version 1.0.X. The pokemon will then be placed either into your party or in the PC storage.
8. How do I use Mystery Gift?
Take the escalator in a Pokemon Center and talk to the man on the left. Save beforehand to prevent issues. Make sure you type the code correctly, and double check I's, 0's, and L's for upper/lowercase.

10. How do I Wonder Trade?
Beat Brawly then go to your PC at home. This will trade your pokemon away for another of the same level.
11. What are Hidden Pokemon?
Hidden pokemon are on the bottom of the Dexnav and will only appear once you have activated the function by talking to a scientist in Devoncorp. After that, you can encounter extra pokemon after having already seen them before. They also have a chance to appear through a special detection feature after making 100 steps and not encountering any pokemon.
12. How do I shiny hunt?
It is best to perform a 'chain'. This means encountering a Dexnav pokemon and either capturing or defeating it. Each pokemon will increase your shiny percentage chance as long as the chain is not broken.
13. Where to find 'X' evolution stone?
Most of the evolution items are sold by a merchant at Slateport city market.
14. How do I train for the Elite 4?
Find the highest exp value pokemon that you can 1 shot and farm it with the dexnav, as the levels increase with chains.
Exp share. Lucky egg. Exp charm. (if you can get them prior to beating the e4)\n
Vivillon is a great grinding mon, especially for special attackers. It's one of the very few pokemon that give 3 EVs per kill. 1 hp, 1 sp att and 1 speed. Incredibly useful to have early in the game.\n
## Randomizer
* **Wild Pokémon**
  * Randomizes wild encounter based on the species and the route
  * Every species gets swapped with another species
    * Example: a Zigzagoon on route 101 gets exchanged for a different Pokémon than on route 102
* **Trainer**
  * The Pokémon of Trainer parties get randomized based on the species and the route
  * It uses a different calculation than the wild encounter
    * Example: a wild Zigzagoon gets exchanged for a different Pokémon than a Trainer's Zigzagoon on the same route
* **Legendaries**
  * Now includes legendary Pokémon in the rotation
* **Type**
  * Pokémon types are random per species
    * Example: all Zigzagoons have the same random types thoughout the game
* **Moves**
  * Moves are randomized based on the move id and the species
    * Example: all Zigzagoons have the same random move pool, but every Pokémon species gets another move for Tackle
* **Abilities**
  * Randomizes the abilities based on the ability id and the species
* **Evolutions**
  * Randomizes the outcome of a evolution based on species
    * Example: a Treecko evolves at level 16 into e.g. a Ditto
* **Evolution methods**
  * Randomizes the requierements for evolutions, based on species
    * Example: a Ditto could now evolve with a Leaf Stone into a Vileplume
* **Type effectiveness**
* **Items**
  * Randomizes items that a recieved from NPCs, found as Pokéballs in the overworld or are hidden in the overworld
    * Key items like the Bike or Fishing Rods are not randomized!
    * TMs only get exchanged for other TMs
## Challenges
* **Evolution limit**
  * Limits the evolutions of Pokémon
    * First: Pokémon can only evolve into their first evolution in the evolution line
      * Example: Treecko can only evolve into Grovyle, but Grovyle will not evolve any further
    * All: Pokémon will not evolve at all!
* **Party limit**
  * Limits the amount of Pokémon the player can have in their party to 6/5/4/3/2/1
* **Nuzlocke mode**
  * Enables Nuzlocke mode with the following rules:
    * Only the first encounter per route can be caught, shown with a small 1 icon where the caught Pokéball otherwise is
    * If a Pokémon faints in battle it gets automatically released
      * Held items are returned to the player upon release
      * **WHITEOUT**
        * Normal: The first Pokémon in your storage gets added to your party. If your storage is empty, the game soft resets to the last save!
        * Hard: Savegame gets **DELETED**
    * Every Pokémon has to be nicknamed, including starter, wild catches, gifted Pokémon, from eggs hatched Pokémon
    * Species clause is active, meaining you can not catch a Pokémon in the same evolution line twice
      * Example: you can NOT catch a Zigzagoon on route 101 and a Zigzagoon on route 102, or any Linoone later
      * But a "first" encounter with an already caught species does NOT use up the current route first encounter!!!
    * Shiny clause active, meaning ALL shiny Pokémon can be caught regardless of any other rules!
* **Level cap**
  * Implements a level cap based on the gym badges collected
  * Pokémon will not recieve any EXP. Points once they reach the cap
    * Normal: Level cap is the level of the next gym's highest Pokémon
    * Hard: Level cap is the level of the next gym's **lowest** Pokémon
* **Experience multiplier**
  * Multiplies the EXP. Points gained by the factor choosen
  * Options are 1.0 (normal), 1.5, 2.0 and 0.0
    * On the 0.0 option Pokémon do NOT gain ANY experience
      * It probably needs an alternative system for leveling, like buyable rare candy to be viably used
* **Player items**
  * Disables the players ability to use items in battle like Potions or Burn Heals
  * Held items on Pokémon are still allowed!
* **Trainer items**
  * Enemy trainer can NOT use any items like Hyper Potions
* **Pokécenter usage**
  * Disables all free healing spots in the game like Pokécenter, Mom or any beds
* **One Type challenge**
  * Limits the Pokémon Type the player can use to ONE
  * Pokémon that do not have the specified type in slot1 or slot2 can NOT be caught
  * Starter Pokémon are randomized and all 3 options are of the choosen type
* **Base stat equalizer**
  * All Pokémon have the same base stat value choosen for each stat (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
  * Options are: 100, 255 or 500
    * Stats still get calculated based on the Pokémon's level, IVs and EVs\nMr. Kip doesn't give out its prompt\nMr. Kip doesn't makeup answers\nHuman: ${pokemonName}.\nMr. Kip:`;
